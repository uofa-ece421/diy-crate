# Document IT Yourself

Please see the [rustdoc book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html)
for a description of Rust's documentation support.

This repository implements serialio: a simple library, or _crate_, that provides a send/recv
API across SPI and UARTs. Your task is to explore rust, cargo, and rustdoc to
refactor and document the crate.
